## Prisma information

Migration is manually generated data model.
Introspection is automatically generated data model (npx prisma db pull) 
Previously you have data on database then introspection work automatically.


```npx prisma migrate dev --name InitUser```

model attributes must have double @@map or anything
Prisma support "" code not '' or `` only "" support
